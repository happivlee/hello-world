# hello-world
This is me practicing GitHub's tutorial so I know how to use GitHub.

Today is 2/17/2017. It's raining outside. This is exactly a month to the day that I first learned about bootcamps and what they can offer and how to get into them. Since then, I've started learning the basics of coding Javascript via Codecademy, and I've been looking at bootcamps such as: Hackreactor, Hackbright, and General Assembly. I was dragging myself through the tutorials at first, but it made more sense after taking a tour at Hackreactor, as well as talking to friends who've either: taught themself coding, are doing/have done the boot camps, and web developers who shared their honest opinions about the usefulness of bootcamps.

Now I'm working hard to go through practice; I've submitted in one application so far and I'm working on preparing for the technical interview. I'd heard good things about github and seen some of the projects that people can do. There is a cool collection of programming how-to resources that a friend showed me. If I figure out how to create a list on GitHub, I'll include useful links (and non-useful ones to avoid). Hopefully it'll be of use to other non-traditionally-technical background people like myself who are interested in becoming programmers!

Stay tuned...

Oh right, random info about myself. Grew up in Silicon Valley, surrounded by many techies and tech companies; interested in other fields, but checking out and giving programming a real shot as a career possibility! The opportunities are boundless, right? :)

Things I like to do besides "finding the perfect career fit" are: archery, cooking, board games, being outdoors, and watching comedy shows and theatrical performances! I have a riduclously cute and devious Samoyed, too. Her middle name is Nymeria... fellow Game of Thrones fans? ;D
